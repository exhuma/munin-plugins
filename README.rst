Munin Plugins
=============

A collection of munin plugins. Each plugin should have it's own doc. Either
inside the script itself, or as a matching ``.pod`` file.

Github automatically parses the ``.pod`` files and renders them as HTML. So if
you go to https://github.com/exhuma/munin-plugins, you'll have a convenient
way to read the docs.
